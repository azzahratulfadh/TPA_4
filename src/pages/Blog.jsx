        <h2>Shaping a Safer Digital World for Children Together</h2>
            <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has developed two documents that aim to shape a meaningful 
                and coordinated action against all forms of child online exploitation and abuse in the ASEAN region, and beyond
                the Declaration and the Regional Plan of Action on the Protection of Children from all Forms of Online Exploitation 
                and Abuse in ASEAN (ASEAN RPA on COEA).
                Child online exploitation and abuse cannot be dealt with in isolation. It is a global issue that needs a global response 
                as WeProtect Global Alliance's Model National Response clearly outlines. The work of organisations like ASEAN is crucial 
                to ensure that the fight against this threat is truly borderless. Through both the Declaration and the ASEAN RPA on COEA, 
                ASEAN intends to make sure that all its Member States adopt a coordinated approach to end all forms of child online exploitation 
                and abuse.
                In the Declaration, ASEAN Member States commit to further protect children from all forms of online exploitation 
                and abuse by prioritising seven measures that represent the key elements which can help shape a safer digital world for children 
                in the ASEAN region and beyond. For each of these measures, a corresponding Focus Area and Activities are developed in the RPA on 
                COEA to translate the commitments stipulated in the Declaration into actions at both national and regional levels.
